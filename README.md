# Learn Japan Through Travel Planning

### Gist
KataMichi (片道) is a map-first travel planning tool designed to help you learn Japan by exploring it through one-way trips. 

### How
- You pick a starting prefecture/airport, a rough timeframe, and a region you want to visit, and the app visualizes estimated flight prices across that region—then lets you "chain" the journey by treating each selected destination as the next origin.
- Along the way, it surfaces practical prefecture insights (cost vibe, climate, highlights) so planning a route doubles as learning geography and travel context.
- Built with a Leaflet-based interactive map and a budget-aware live pricing backend (Cloudflare Worker + caching), it stays fast and scalable while keeping real-world flight data optional and controlled.
